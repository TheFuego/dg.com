                    <p><i>Niš Fortress</i> is a fortress in the city of Niš, Serbia. It is a complex and important cultural and historical monument. It rises on the right bank of the Nišava River, overlooking the area inhabited for longer than two millennia. It was protected by law in May 1948 as it was declared a cultural site of great significance. The current condition of the fortress lists it as one of the best preserved fortifications of this kind in Serbia as well as on the Balkan Peninsula.</p>

                    <p>Čegar is a location in Serbia, near the city of Niš, where the Battle of Čegar Hill took place. Today's monument in the shape of a tower - a symbol of the soldiers' fortification - was erected for the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of Niš from the Turks, on June 1, 1927. In 1938 a bronze bust of Stevan Sinđelić was positioned in the semicircular niche of the monument. It is the symbol of the city municipality of Pantelej, the home of FK Sinđelić and is featured on the current crest of the club.</p>

He fought in many battles and skirmishes against Ottoman foot-soldiers, though he is mostlz remembered for his actions during the Battle of Čegar Hill near Niš in 1809, in which he and hus brigade found themselves surrounded by the Ottomans. Encircled and without much chance of survival, Sinđelić ignited the gunpowder kegs in the powder cave, creating an enormous explosion that killed him, along with all of the Serbian and Ottoman soldiers in his trench.</p>
